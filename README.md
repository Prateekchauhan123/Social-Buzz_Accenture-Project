Description

About this project and my role:
In this project, I am working as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
my work within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility.
my team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz.
You’re hoping for a promotion at work, and this is an exciting opportunity for you to showcase your data analysis and visualization skills.

Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Analyst
A data analyst sits between the business and the data.
The Business refers to the client and your internal team members who won’t be involved in detailed data analysis.
They rely on your analysis to make strategic business decisions.
Importantly, not everyone will have a strong understanding of data. Your job is to communicate your data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.
 
The Data refers to the relevant data sources that you will clean, process, and use to generate interesting insights for the business.

Process for Business Project:
Requirements gathering
Definitions of different data types:first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question 
- which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
- So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

Data cleaning
Second: Clean the data by:
removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. 
If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.
 
Data modelling
1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
use of “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
use the “Sum If” formula
